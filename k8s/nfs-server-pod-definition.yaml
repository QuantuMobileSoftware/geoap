metadata:

  name: simple-volume-pod

spec:

  # Volumes are declared by the pod. They share its lifecycle

  # and are communal across containers.

  volumes:

    # Volumes have a name and configuration based on the type of volume.

    # In this example, we use the emptyDir volume type

    - name: simple-vol

      emptyDir: {} # No extra configuration

    # Now, one of our containers can mount this volume and use it like

    # any other directory.

  containers:
    - name: my-container
      volumeMounts:
        - name: simple-vol # This is the name of the volume we set at the pod level
          mountPath: /var/simple # Where to mount this directory in our container

      # Now that we have a directory mounted at /var/simple, let's
      # write to a file inside it!
